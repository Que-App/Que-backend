# About

**Que is a tool that allows for even, fair and organized distribution of cyclic tasks among the members of a group.**

This implementation of project is made as a proof of concept for one use case specifically â€“ to 
distribute taking notes in school evenly across the members of the class. Despite that, the idea is 
more universal and so will be the final implementation of the project, which will allow it to support 
even more use cases, like household chores, sharing a single item (like computer) or sharing 
responsibilities to name a few.

The main idea behind the implementation is that the points of time in which something is happening
should be independent of the people assigned to these points in time. As a result of that, if the point
in time is drops no one misses his turn, and when the user drops the next user is assigned instead.

With this solution, each user has no interest of the state of the queue besides his turns, which allows
for swaps between users in the same queue or even between queues, which is already implemented.

Provided the proof-of-concept implementation will pass the tests and meet our expectations, we
seek to further develop and expand this idea which, we hope, will result in publicly available
universal solution.

# API
All API post responses and requests have a content Method of `application/json` and encoding UTF-8.
The format of the string date is "yyyy-mm-dd", format of the string time is "hh:mm:ss" unless specified 
otherwise.

**ALL URLS ARE PRECEDED BY A PREFIX:** `/api/v1`

## Authentication
API uses JTW based authentication, the token is required for every request except the login. It should
be sent in an `Authentication` header.

## Errors
**All errors returned by the API will follow the error scheme.**
The scheme consists of:

### Error
- `status`: `String` - The string value of error code, for example `BAD_REQUEST` for `400`
- `message`: `String`
- `suggestedAction`: `String`
- `subErrors`: `Array` - An array of [SubErrors](#SubError).
- `timestamp`: `String` representing a timestamp in format "dd:mm:yyyy hh:mm:ss" 
<a name="SubError"></a>
### SubError
- `message`: `String`
- `suggestedAction`: `String`

**An example of an error:**
```
{
  "status": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "suggestedAction": "Take look at the errors",
  "subErrors": [
    {
      "message": "Invalid value: null - Please specify old password",
      "suggestedAction": "Check the rejected value against error"
    },
    {
      "message": "Invalid value: null - Please specify new password",
      "suggestedAction": "Check the rejected value against error"
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "17-01-2021 01:17:41"
